# Deploying IBM MQ Native HA using the Helm Chart on Rancher RKE2 and OpenEBS
These instructions will deploy IBM MQ Native HA in [RKE2](https://docs.rke2.io) with three worker nodes.

## Pre-reqs
Prior to using the Helm chart you will need to install four dependencies:
1. [Helm version 3](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
2. [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
3. [RKE2](https://docs.rke2.io/install/quickstart)
4. [OpenEBS](https://openebs.io/docs/user-guides/installation)

## Installation
1. Install your RKE2 Cluster on a Cloud provider or Linux boxes, and deploy the OpenEBS chart. To install OpenEBS follow the procedure documented [here](https://openebs.io/docs/user-guides/installation). It will install a number of Storage Classes including `openebs-hostpath`. You can install aditional providers like LVM, but this is optional.
2. Run the installation command to deploy an instance of the helm chart: `./install.sh <namespace>`            
    Where \<namespace\> is the Kubernetes namespace where the resources should be deployed into. This will deploy a number of resources:
    * The IBM MQ Helm Chart using the properties within the [secureapp.yaml](deploy/secureapp.yaml) file.
    * A configMap with MQ configuration to define a default Queue, and the security required.
    * A secret that includes certificates and keys from the `genericresources/createcerts` directory. Assuring the communication in MQ is secure.
1. This will take a minute or so to deploy, and the status can be checked with the following command: `kubectl -n $TARGET_NAMESPACE rollout status statefulset secureapphelm-ibm-mq --watch`.

## Testing

The prerequisite is that the IBM MQ is installed under `/opt/mqm` directory or binaries (Redistributable client) are available in the same path on the host machine on which the testing is carried out. 

Navigate to `../test` directory. No modifications should be required, as the endpoint configuration for your environment will be discovered automatically.

1. To initiate the testing, run the `./sendMessage.sh <namespace>` command. It will then connect to MQ and start sending messages immediately.

1. Open another terminal window and run the `./getMessage.sh <namespace>` command. You should see all of the messages being sent by the sendMessaging command.

1. To see how the pods work together in action, run the `kubectl get pod | grep secureapp` command on another terminal windows to view the current pods, and then delete the running pod (the one with the ready state of `1/1`) by running the command: `kubectl delete pod secureapphelm-ibm-mq-0` (where the pod name is customized based on which one is active). Once the active pod is deleted, the application connections will then reconnect to the other pod.

1. You can clean up the resources by navigating to the `../deploy` directory and running the command `./cleanup.sh <namespace>`. This will delete everything. Do not worry if you receive messages about PVCs not being found, this is a generic clean-up script and assumes a worst case scenario.
